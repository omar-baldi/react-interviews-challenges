### React challenge

---

Write a component that implements a timer.

The component should display the elapsed time in minutes and seconds, formatted as "MM:SS"

The timer should start at 10 minutes and count down every second.
When the timer runs out restart it from 10 minutes again. The timer should persist, meaning that when the user closes the page (or refresh) the timer picks up where it stopped.
