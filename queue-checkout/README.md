### React challenge

In a grocery store, there are 5 queues. Each queue may have "n" numbers representing the groceries for each person in the queue.

The goal is to create an interactive interface where users can input the number of groceries and, upon submission, the input is added to the queue with the least items.

Additionally, every "m" milliseconds, the quantity of groceries for the first person in each queue
will decrease by 1 until they are empty.
